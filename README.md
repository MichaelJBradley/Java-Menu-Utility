# Java-Menu-Utility
This menu utiliy makes creating and using text menus in Java fast and easy. Make a static or mutable menu that displays its 
contents with the just call of a function. Get proper input from even the most destructive user who actively tries to break
your program! Want to make sure a user chooses each option before moving on? This utility records it for you. All of this
wrapped up in a neat little library.
